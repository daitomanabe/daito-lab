# daito-lab

This repository contains **experimental, work-in-progress, and disposable projects** published under:

https://lab.daito.ws

## Purpose
- Rapid experimentation
- Technical and conceptual prototyping
- Exploring ideas before they are stabilized or archived

## Characteristics
- Projects may break, change structure, or be abandoned
- Build systems and frameworks may vary freely
- No guarantee of long-term availability or backward compatibility

## Deployment
- Deployed via Cloudflare Pages
- One repository → one build → one experimental site

## Lifecycle
- Projects here are expected to be temporary
- Selected projects may be promoted to `daito-projects`
- Most projects will eventually be discarded

This repository optimizes for speed and freedom, not permanence.
